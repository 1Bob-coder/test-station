# DripScripts
### DRIP Scripts
This folder holds all the DRIP scripts.  All DRIP scripts are of the form
        name.drip
where name can be any name, and the extension is .drip.
Most DRIP script files are generated on the fly since they tend to do one or two
commands and are temporary, but reside in this directory.
